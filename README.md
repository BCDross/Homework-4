# Homework-4

This website will take in three words via browser prompt window when the user clicks the "Enter 3 words" button. Once three words are entered the list will be displayed and another button will appear that will let the user swap the letters. Which will display a new panel and display the three words with the first and last letter swapped. 

Palendroms need not apply. :)
